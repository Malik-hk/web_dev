The code in each directory stands alone, not relying on other directories. 

I'm building and gathering diverse web pages and websites within this single repository. I'm tackling these projects on my own to boost my web development skills and explore web penetration testing. 

After creating a webpage, I conduct a penetration test to practice finding vulnerabilities. With this dual method, I not only assess websites for vulnerabilities but also contribute to the development of secure websites.

It's an exciting learning journey in both domains.
